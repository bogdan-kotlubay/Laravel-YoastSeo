# Laravel-YoastSeo

This is Complete Laravel YoastSeo package using built in Vue Component.

After months of reasearch and figured out that there is no package built for laravel.

No good documentation of YoastSeoJS in their own repo of how to use their internal components.

So this is Vue-Component which can be used in any existing Laravel Project or in Vue Project (SPAs).

Steps to use:
 1. Use Virtual host or serve your Laravel project.
 2. Install Node and then use npm install and run npm run prod.
 3. Open the Project homepage mainly Laravel Welcome Page (ie., http://larevel-yoast-vue/  OR localhost:8080/ ) which you should see a yoast form.
